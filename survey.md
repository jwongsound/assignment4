For a highly representative and comprehensive data pool, data for this system shall be gathered by way of a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire shall seek to establish, or refute, as the case may be, the claim that students of the Explores Academy need some sort of platform to express their academic needs and level of satisfaction with the Academy's provision of facilities and services, as well as to indicate the kind and nature of features to be had by this platform.
